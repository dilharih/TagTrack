# TagTrack

TagTrack is a full-stack price tracking web application that allows users to paste a product link from major e-commerce platforms and retrieve historical pricing data scraped from third-party sources. It also uses machine learning (Facebook Prophet) to forecast future prices. Built with Flask on the backend, it automates data collection using Selenium, displays product and pricing info, and offers predictive insights to help users make informed purchase decisions.
